# SignUp-With-Provider-Bloc
This Flutter project is a modern cross-platform (Web, Android, iOS) Application SignUp Process that is managed with professional state management. The classes for the UI remain the same in both the following branches, what changes is the State Management methods. We try to avoid using StatefulWidgets for the purpose of calling SetState() method, because it is known to produce unncessary UI reloads and make unprofessional apps. We try to use StatelessWidgets as much as possible and use Stateful only when necessary.
# Bloc Branch
